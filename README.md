# Kelsey's Technical Writing Portfolio
## Overview
This repository is a collection of my technical writing samples, from how-to guides, user manuals and other stuff.
## About Me
I have over three years of experience in content writing, journalism and editing. I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and Professional Writing and have completed a Technical Communications Essentials certificate from BCIT.

My interest in Technical Writing revolves around a love of making technical concepts easy to understand, helping others learn how to use new products or software, and learning about new technical advancements when creating documentation.
