# Kelsey's Technical Writing Portfolio
## :page_with_curl: Overview
This repository is a portfolio of my technical writing samples, from how-to guides, user manuals and documentation. My main content writing portfolio and blog can be found on [kelseyriveramedina.com](https://www.kelseyriveramedina.com/).
## :raising_hand_woman: About me
I have over two years of professional experience in content writing, journalism and editing. I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in English & Professional Writing and have completed a Technical Communications Essentials certificate from BCIT.

My interest in Technical Writing revolves around a love of making technical concepts easy to understand, helping others learn how to use new products or software, and learning how to improve documentation to enhance the user's experience.

### Table of Contents
| Name | Type | Summary
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| Close-Up Wildlife Photography Without Hi-Tech Equipment  | How-To  | This is a how-to guide created during my time as a student at BCIT, and is a redesign of an Instructable guide rewritten for clarity.
| Keyboard User Manual  | User Manual  | I redesigned the user manual for my keyboard which was originally only written in Chinese and Ukrainian. Rewritten with an international/English-speaking audience in mind, this manual shows readers how to set up, use and troubleshoot their keyboard.
